			<p>Oral anti-diabetics are prescribed medications in pill-form to help regulate blood glucose. </p>
			<p>Type 2 diabetes is an always-changing condition. Research suggests you may need to switch up how you manage diabetes-including medication-every five to 10 years. Generally, blood glucose monitoring before and after eating meals is used to help determine the most appropriate diabetes medication. </p>
			<p>The key to finding the right oral anti-diabetic is to identify your blood glucose patterns. So, I would have the patient log their blood sugar testing over a week, and that will show me any patterns. Insulin does work well to correct most blood sugars, but if someone isn't ready to go on insulin, we can figure out which oral anti-diabetics may help.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Metformin</span> is one of the best medicines for Type 2 diabetes, and is one of only two anti-diabetics considered an essential medicine by the World Health Organization.</p>
			<p>As for what's new in diabetes management technology, there are also DPP4 inhibitors, such as <span class="bold">Januvia</span> or <span class="bold">Trajenta</span>, that are very effective at correcting high blood sugars in the morning. And they can also control post-meal blood sugars. They come in tablet form, they tend to be taken only once a day, they're not associated with low blood sugars and they work very nicely in combination with Metformin.</p>
			<p>We also have medications that increase the secretion of insulin if, say, your blood sugars are high after a meal because your body isn’t producing insulin fast enough in response to your food. <span class="bold">Gluconorm</span> or <span class="bold">Diamicron</span> work very, very well to help correct that type of problem.</p>
			<p>The thing with diabetes is that managing it is more than just medications; it's life-encompassing. Management also includes a huge lifestyle component of exercise, diet and nutrition that should never be forgotten. But right now, you have many oral anti-diabetic options to help manage Type 2 diabetes."</p>
