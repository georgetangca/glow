			<p>Your Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacist can help you renew your medications. Every time you get your prescriptions and over-the-counter medications from your Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy, you can ask for a review and assessment of your medications. This will ensure the accuracy and safety of your medications.Also, when you pick up your prescription, every prescription is checked using the following list:</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Confirmed your personal information and medical history, including possible allergies</li>
				<li>Checked to make sure that your prescription is both accurate and complete and that your medication, its dose, quantity and directions are right for you</li>
				<li>Check for potential problems with your prescription, such as interactions with other medications, allergies and contraindications to the medication prescribed, and duplication of therapy</li>
				<li>If needed, worked with your doctor to resolve any of the above</li>
				<li>Provided counselling to explain the optimal use of your medication, plus additional storage and administration instructions </li>
				<li>May have provided information on your medical condition to help you better manage your therapy</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Also, your pharmacist may follow up with a telephone call to ensure continued proper and safe use of your medication. In some instances, we may have also contacted your insurance company on your behalf to help resolve any prescription coverage issues.</p>
