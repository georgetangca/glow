			<p>Ask for a Sharps Container from your pharmacist. It’s made of hard plastic, so needles won’t poke through and injure anyone, and it’s labelled with bio-hazard caution stickers. Take it home with you and place used blood-testing materials inside. Once it’s filled (up to the fill line clearly displayed on the container), just take it back to your Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy. There they will dispose of it safely, so it doesn’t harm anyone or the environment.  You can also take back other unused and/or expired medications, too. Talk to your pharmacist about how to be a part of the program.</p>
