			<h1><span>Know your numbers: How to read your blood pressure</span></h1>
			<p>A blood pressure reading shows how hard the heart is pumping by measuring the force of the blood pressing on the walls of the arteries. The higher the numbers, the harder your heart is working. </p>
			<p>Below 140/90</p>
			<p>This is a normal blood pressure reading (measured in mmHG or millimetres of mercury). The top number (systolic) measures pressure of the arteries when the heart contracts and the bottom number (diastolic) measures it when the heart relaxes.</p>
			<p>For most people with diabetes, blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg or greater is considered high, and their doctor should monitor it. </p>

			<h1><span>How do I know which glucose meter I should get for my loved one?</span></h1>
			<p>The type of glucose meter that's right for them depends on the type of diabetes they have, the frequency of monitoring required and the level of technology you want. It's also important to assess their needs: Do they want a blood sugar monitor so they can maintain a log? Or are they interested in using one that has some sort of technology associated with it?</p>
			<p>Bayer's Contour USB is a blood glucose monitor that you can plug directly into your computer, so you don't have to write out a log for them. The iBGStar is a blood glucose monitor that attaches to your iPhone, so the information goes directly to your phone. </p>
			<p>But if they're taking insulin, then you're looking for a monitor that is more advanced. The FreeStyle InsuLinx, which is a mealtime insulin calculator, can help people who use insulin many times throughout the day. Studies have shown that people using this type of monitor are better protected against low blood sugars, because they're more accurately estimating the correct insulin doses. Nine out of 10 people will be using less insulin as a result of this. </p>
			<p>There's also the OneTouch Verio IQ, which is an excellent monitor for people who are using multiple daily doses of insulin, because it helps them identify patterns in the blood sugar. </p>
			<p>If they're taking oral medications or are managing blood sugars through diet and nutrition, you may not need a complicated meter. Some simple ones include the Bayer Contour Next.</p>

			<h1><span>Tracking blood sugars</span></h1>
			<p>A1C testing</p>
			<p>While glucose meters assess blood sugar for the exact moment at which it's tested, only an A1C test can take into account a much longer time frame the past three months to assess blood sugar control. Your physician may test for it once every three months, or even annually, if they feel it is appropriate for you.</p>
			<p>The test is similar to blood sugar testing, in that it requires a small blood sample. But instead of strips, a cartridge is used, because a few more steps are needed to examine the sample. It takes about five minutes for results, versus the few seconds it takes for the blood sugar testing you would do every day.</p>
			<p>You can have the A1C test done at select Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacies, and you can also buy a kit to take home. To help understand the results and to ensure proper testing procedures, it's best to have it done at the pharmacy or have your pharmacist review the analysis.</p>
			<p>Contact your local Shoppers Drug Mart for info on the in-store A1C test. <a href="http://www1.shoppersdrugmart.ca/en/Store-Locator.aspx">http://www1.shoppersdrugmart.ca/en/Store-Locator.aspx</a></p>
			
			<h1><span>Diabetes logbook</span></h1>
			<p>Keep track of everyday sugar levels by writing down readings in the Shoppers Drug Mart Diabetes Logbook. Convenient to carry (smaller and thinner than a chequebook), it records up to 12 weeks of results and is a great tool for reporting glucose meter results to a health care provider. The logbook is straightforward, making it easy to visually understand progress in controlling sugar levels. Other features include a reference section on managing diabetes and target blood sugar levels, a medication list and a schedule. The Shoppers Drug Mart Diabetes Logbook is free just ask for it at the pharmacy counter.</p>
