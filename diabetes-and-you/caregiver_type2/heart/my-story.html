			<p>Plant sterols help to lower total cholesterol and LDL (bad cholesterol), but they maintain HDL (good cholesterol) at a stable level. This little juggling act makes them the perfect ally for the heart health of someone living with diabetes. Some researchers have observed that these effects are even stronger in people who have Type 2 diabetes. </p>
			<p>Also known as phytosterols, plant sterols are compounds found in plants and vegetables that structurally resemble cholesterol. However, unlike cholesterol, they are good for you. </p>
			<p>Sesame seeds and sesame oil are good sources, as well as wheat germ, corn oil and some nuts. Plant sterols are also added to foods like margarine, yogurt and orange juice. (Packaging usually makes prominent mention of this—check to be sure.) You can also add plant sterols to your diet with supplements.</p>
			<p>Recent research has found that regular consumption of phytosterols is beneficial for heart health. Because they are structurally similar to cholesterol, they bind with it in the intestine, and that prevents the body from absorbing bad cholesterol. This is why many dietitians, doctors and pharmacists encourage taking phytosterol supplements with a meal.</p>
			<p>High cholesterol is a prominent risk factor for heart disease, and this is especially true for people living with diabetes. So keeping cholesterol under control should be a top priority.</p>
			
			<h1><span>The bottom line</span></h1>
			<p>Including phytosterols in one’s diet can help manage high cholesterol. Generally, the daily safe reference intake for adults is between one and three grams a day. Check with your doctor and/or pharmacist to determine the right dosage.</p>
			<p>Note: Before taking any supplements, it’s always important to run it by a doctor. Plant sterols are not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or those on cholesterol-lowering medication.</p>
