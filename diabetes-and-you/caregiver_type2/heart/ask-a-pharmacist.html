			<p>â€œHaving diabetes increases the risk for developing coronary artery disease. And because controlling blood sugars is necessary to prevent a heart attack or stroke, a diet thatâ€™s low in saturated fats and high in fibre is key. The dietary recommendations in Canadaâ€™s Food Guide are always best. That said, there are a lot of natural health products that may also help to prevent cardiovascular disease and, ultimately, heart attacks. Here are a few.</p>
			<p>Fish oilsâ€”including omega-3, -6 and -9 fatty acidsâ€”are known to help reduce risk. Essentially, you should be looking for a supplement that offers a combination of polyunsaturated fatty acids called EPA and DHA. </p>
			<p>There is some evidence to suggest that garlicâ€”specifically aged garlicâ€”helps reduce the risk for heart attack. If you can add it to their diet, thatâ€™s great. If they are not a big fan of the taste, supplements may be easier to take.</p>
			<p>The antioxidant coenzyme Q10 is another health product that we think may help with cardiovascular disease. </p>
			<p>Psyllium fibre, which can be found in LIFE BRAND TK, can help lower cholesterolâ€”namely the bad kind, LDL. It is inexpensive and very easy to take. It is also taken for constipation, but weâ€™re starting to see it marketed for heart health as well. </p>
			<p>And donâ€™t forget to give them a daily multivitamin.â€�</p>
