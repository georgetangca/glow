			<h1><span>Ask a pharmacist, with Owner and Associate Christine Singh, Certified Diabetes Educator, Toronto</span></h1>
				<p>"You're not alone. Frustration and confusion associated with diabetes is common. Your community pharmacist can be a valuable ally in navigating these feelings. There are various pharmacy resources and services available to help reduce both frustration and confusion." </p>
				<p>"If costs associated with treatment and blood glucose monitoring are the primary source of your frustration, your pharmacist can direct you to various programs developed to assist caregivers of diabetes patients with related costs, [such as] the Canadian Diabetes Association's (CDA) Monitoring for Health Program and those run by individual pharmaceutical companies that manufacture diabetes supplies. "</p>
				<p>"Blood glucose monitoring can be difficult and time consuming. Beyond helping you understand what their blood sugar targets should be, and why, when and how you monitor blood sugars, Shoppers Drug Mart can provide in-store glucose monitor training, A1C blood testing and personal blood glucose log books, enabling you to monitor their diabetes."  </p>
				<p>"To make dealing with medication and nutrition more manageable, your pharmacist has valuable information on hand, including safe and effective over-the-counter medications, vitamins and supplements, as well as an overview of their current medications, both prescription and over-the-counter." </p>
				<p>Many Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacists are Certified Diabetes Educators (CDE).</p>
