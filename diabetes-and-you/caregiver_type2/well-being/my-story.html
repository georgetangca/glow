			<h1><span>MY STORY</span></h1>
			<p>Diabetes affects the whole family, not just those with the disease. I began caring for my husband 20 years after he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. He didn't really manage the disease before I started caring for him. His medications seemed to mitigate the progression of the disease.  He found pleasure in playing golf several times a week, although he did little else for exercise as the doctor suggested. </p>
			<p>It wasn't until we moved to another city that our new doctor, in conjunction with an endocrinologist, decided that his medication was not working as well as it should. They suggested my husband go on insulin to stabilize the diabetes. He was also enrolled in the diabetes clinic at the hospital. I attended the clinics with him, and dealt with the dieticians, the foot nurses, the doctors and his other health care providers. But it was more than that. I prepared meals in accordance with diabetic guidelines. I applied lotion regularly to his feet and legs and monitored his blood pressure. My task was to make sure he took his blood sugar readings on a regular basis and keep his insulin pin full and set for him to administer himself. At this point, I had to stop working to become his full-time caregiver.  </p>
			<p>I know I am not alone. Caregivers spend many hours of each day caring for, advocating for worrying about and supporting those living with the disease. Diabetes eventually impacts on all parts of the body: the heart, the eyes, circulation, and the kidneys—leading to more medical complications. Thus stress became a major factor in my role as his caregiver. I had to find healthy ways to channel my emotions. Writing definitely helped. I participated in a research project focusing on the caregivers’ perspective. I wrote down my emotions for a three month period. It was a release of my feelings, of my relationship with my husband and the impact diabetes had on us. I laughed, I cried, I remembered, I projected. It lessened my stress so I could carry on. </p>
