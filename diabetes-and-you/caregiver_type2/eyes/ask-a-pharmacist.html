			<p> â€œFirst, itâ€™s important to understand why you should be concerned about their eye health. Diabetes is the single leading cause of blindness in Canada. It also raises the risk of developing blurred vision, cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, in which the small blood vessels in the retina become damaged.  	As for how you can help them maintain their eye health: The most important thing is to stay on top of them about controlling their blood sugars and maintaining a well-balanced diet. Taking prescription medications and insulin is going to reduce the risk of those conditions. In addition, there is some evidence mounting that certain vitamins and minerals can help prevent some of these complications in patients with diabetes. We know vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, copper, lutein and even beta-carotene can help. You can take them all individually or in a multi-vitamin created specifically for eye health. Check with your local pharmacist to see what is the best one for the person you're caring for.â€�</p>
