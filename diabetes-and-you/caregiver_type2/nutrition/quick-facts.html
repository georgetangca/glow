			<h1><span>Quick Facts: Nutrition</span></h1>
			
			<p>Carbohydrates are the sugars, starches and fibre in foods. Carbs cause blood sugar to rise as they’re converted into energy, but they’re nutrients our bodies need.</p>
			
			<h1><span>The key is to be clever about carbs:</span></h1>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Be sure their diet is made up of foods loaded with vitamins and minerals, such as fruits and vegetables, instead of food that’s low in nutrition, like processed foods.</li>
				<li>Don’t pass up high-fibre foods just because their total carb count looks high. Fibre is healthy to eat. Try this calculation first: Take the carb count and subtract the fibre. That is the actual carb count.</li>
			</ul>			
			<p>(add in nutrition facts image)</p>
			<p>This is a nutrition facts label for a one-cup serving of generic bran cereal. When preparing this for your loved one, you would subtract the three grams of fibre from the 22 grams of carbohydrates. Even though fibre is considered a carbohydrate, it is not absorbed into the body the way the other carbs are. So the carb count for the cereal would be 19 grams, not 22 grams as listed on the package.</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Some foods naturally contain sugar, but don’t be put off by high natural-sugar content in healthy foods like fruit and dairy products. Just consider the serving size for these.</li>
				<li>Remember, foods that are sugar-free or have no added sugar can be high in carbs. Check the label of packaged foods to be sure.</li>
				<li>The carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio varies from person to person, so talk to their health care provider about counting carbs and how to maintain blood sugar levels.</li>	
			</ul>
			
			<h1><span>The GI diet</span></h1>
			<p>The glycemic index (GI) is not only a useful weight-loss tool, it’s also a diabetes-friendly approach to food and eating. It is a system of ranking food to understand its effects on blood sugar, which can help explain any highs or lows that often happen.</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>The GI is a ranking of the effect a carbohydrate has on your blood sugar.</li>
				<li>Foods with a high GI score (70-100) are said to cause a quick rise in blood sugar because they’re digested quickly. Foods with a low GI score (0-55) are believed to make a more gradual impact.</li>
				<li>People with diabetes may follow the GI diet to control their blood glucose levels.</li>
				<li>The GI isn’t an exact science. How your blood sugar reacts to a food can be different depending on when you eat it, how it’s cooked and what else is on your plate.</li>
				<li>A few low-GI foods, like potato chips, are high in fat and calories. Try to avoid processed foods, even if they’re ranked low in GI.</li>
			</ul>
