			<p>While you might be concerned about counting carbs, know that not all carbs are created equal. Some are more nutritious than others. Despite having the same carb count (12 grams), your loved one would get more fibre, selenium and manganese from a slice of brown bread than they would from a cappuccino. Because diabetes can cause health complications, it's best they follow a healthy diet that will keep their weight in check, as well as their cholesterol. Generally encourage them to go for low-calorie foods that are low in sugar and saturated fats and high in fibre.</p>
