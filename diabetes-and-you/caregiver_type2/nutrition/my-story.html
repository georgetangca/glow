			<p class="greenFeature"><span>â€œIâ€™m a 46-year-old woman named Abby. My mother, Muriel, is 80 years old. She lives with me and has Type 2 diabetes, as well as late-stage Alzheimerâ€™s disease and diverticulosis.</span></p>
			<div class="paragraph-area">
			<h1><span>My diary</span></h1>
			
			<p>Her diabetes is controlled though diet, and we go for regular blood work every three months to ensure her glucose levels are OK. I try my best to make sure she eats balanced meals, and I encourage her to drink water throughout the day. Unfortunately, due to her Alzheimerâ€™s, she doesnâ€™t remember sheâ€™s eaten, so sheâ€™s hungry about every hour. Itâ€™s very challenging to manage, but it can be done.â€�</p>

			<h1><span>Karenâ€™s Comments:</span></h1>
			<p>â€œYour mom is lucky to have a daughter like you. Given her desire to want to eat all the time, it would be easy to overfeed her, but then she would become overweight, which would be bad for her diabetes. You keep her on a healthy track by giving her small, low-calorie portions of healthy foods throughout the day.</p>
			<p>â€œActually, the way you have balanced her daily intake with small meals and small snacks is a good way for all of us to eat, to prevent or manage diabetes. You only get small blood sugar rises, and these are easier for our pancreas (which makes insulin) to handle. While â€˜grazingâ€™ is good, this type of schedule does not work for people who have too many high-calorie foods around. But for your mom, youâ€™re doing a great job.</p>
			<p>â€œI noticed that you said you encourage your mom to drink water throughout the day. Water is so important to help manage diverticulosis or constipation, as well as diabetes. Itâ€™s easy for an older adult to become dehydrated due to high blood sugar, and she may not be aware herself that sheâ€™s thirsty, so please do continue to remind her to drink water.</p>
			<p>â€œAs your mom requires so much attention, I worry about you! As a caregiver, itâ€™s easy to get burned out. A few hours off here and there, or a day away on a regular basisâ€”when another family member, a friend or a home-care support person steps inâ€”can help keep you healthy and refreshed.</p>
			<p>Three tips for Abby and Muriel:</p>
			<p>1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Along with drinking water, fibre is important in managing diverticulosis. Â To get some extra fibre, substitute a bran muffin for the blueberry muffin, or add some wheat bran or ground flaxseed to her meals and snacks.</p>
			<p>2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Exercise is very important for everyone, including a person with Alzheimerâ€™s. If your mother is agreeable, get her outside for walks with you on nice days.</p>
			<p>3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  As Alzheimerâ€™s progresses, some people have difficulty eating with a fork and knife, so finger foods can work well. Try small hamburger pieces (or chopped up pieces of meatloaf) with cut-up potato chunks and larger pieces of cooked vegetables (such as zucchini chunks)."</p>
