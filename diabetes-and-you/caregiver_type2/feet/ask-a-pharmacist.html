			<p>"People with diabetes are at risk of developing foot problems caused by nerve damage and poor blood flow. High blood glucose can cause damage to nerves in the feet, so a person might not feel pain, heat or cold. This lack of feeling is called peripheral neuropathy, and it can lead to infection. Poor blood flow makes it hard for a sore or infection to heal. Smoking when you have diabetes makes blood flow problems worse. Possible signs and symptoms of nerve damage and poor blood flow include numbness, or reduced ability to feel pain or changes in temperature, especially in the feet and toes. "Keep their feet healthy by watching their blood glucose levels, making sure they are wearing properly fitted shoes, and asking their health care provider for help when needed. Assemble a foot-care kit that contains nail clippers, a nail file, lotion or moisturizer, a pumice stone and a non-breakable hand mirror."</p>
