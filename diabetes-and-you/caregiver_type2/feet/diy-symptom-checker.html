			<p>It starts with a loss of sensation due to damaged nerves, says Dr. Jan Hux, Chief Scientific Advisor at the Canadian Diabetes Association. â€œThose messages of pain that we get from our feet are really important to alert us to a little cut or a little blister, and the problem is that in people with diabetes, thereâ€™s an increased risk for infection, a decreased ability to fight infection and a decreased ability to heal.â€� Take our symptom-checker quiz. </p>

				<li>Have you lost sensation in your feet?</li>

				<li>Do you have dry, cracked skin?</li>
				<li>Do you have any sores, cuts, blisters or hangnails?</li>
				<li>Do you have calluses or corns?</li>
				<li>Do you see any areas of redness?</li>
				<li>Are your feet swollen?</li>
				<li>Have your feet or toes changed shape?</li>
				<li>Are your nails thick and/or ingrown?</li>

			<h1><span>When to see a doctor:</span></h1>
			<p>If you answer â€œyesâ€� to any of these questions, seek medical attention. In addition to having proper-fitting shoes and socks, itâ€™s important to schedule regular doctorâ€™s appointments for foot examinations. Have a friend or family member help inspect your feet daily. (For example, Dr. Hux says to look where a shoe might rub and where calluses might form.) Also consider visiting a chiropodist or a podiatrist to have your nails and feet cared for professionally. </p>
