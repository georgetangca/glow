			<p>“People with diabetes are at risk of developing foot problems caused by nerve damage and poor blood flow. High blood glucose can cause damage to nerves in the feet, so you might not feel pain, heat or cold. This lack of feeling is called peripheral neuropathy, and it can lead to infection. Poor blood flow makes it hard for a sore or infection to heal. Smoking when you have diabetes makes blood flow problems worse.</p>
			<p>“Keep your feet healthy by managing your diabetes and blood glucose levels, wearing properly fitted shoes, and asking your health care provider for help if you experience any problems. Assemble a foot-care kit that contains nail clippers, a nail file, lotion or moisturizer, a pumice stone and a non-breakable hand mirror.”</p>
