			<h1><span>MY DIARY</span></h1>
			<p>“Managing diabetes is not impossible. With practice and education, the burden is lessened. I never wanted to miss out on life, so I learned how to manage my blood sugar so I could become an athlete. I bike-race and run marathons. </p>
			<p>The more I learned about my body, I began to let go of the stress. I can’t get mad at every high or low number I see on my glucose meter—they’re just numbers that tell me what to do next. One day, a certain amount of insulin is perfect; the next day, it could cause stratospheric blood sugars or cause my blood sugar to tank.</p>
			<p>Diabetes requires tremendous amounts of attention—every minute, every day. Nearly every decision I make takes diabetes into consideration. It’s one of the few diseases where managing the condition is patient-driven—and that’s a big deal, given the responsibility of insulin injections and the repercussions of over- or under-dosing. The decisions I make could have intense consequences if I’m not careful. That can be stressful.</p>
			<p>It’s still frustrating to control my blood sugars. Counting the carbohydrates of every bite is hard. Food often means guilt when you live with diabetes. Thinking of ‘What did I do wrong?’ can be tough to deal with. Food is no longer food; it’s numbers. A slice of pizza I shouldn’t have just isn’t worth it. </p>
			<p>It may sound strange, but I’m grateful for what diabetes has done for me. It taught me to be more present in my life and to not sweat the small stuff—as much! Connecting with others and sharing experiences probably helped me more than anything else. It has taught me that highs are normal. And lows are normal, too. I learned I’m not alone.” </p>
