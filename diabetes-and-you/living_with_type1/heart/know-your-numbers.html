			<h1><span>Know your numbers: blood pressure, blood glucose and ketone levels</span></h1>
			<p>A blood pressure reading shows how hard the heart is pumping by measuring the force of the blood pressing on the walls of the arteries. The higher the numbers, the harder your heart is working.</p>
			<p>Below 140/90</p>
			<p>This is a “normal” blood pressure reading (measured in ‘mmHG’ or millimetres of mercury). The top number (systolic) measures pressure of the arteries when the heart contracts and the bottom number (diastolic) measures it when the heart relaxes.</p>
			<p>For most people with diabetes, blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg or greater is considered high, and their doctor should monitor it.</p>

			<h1><span>How do I know which glucose meter I should get? </span></h1>
			
			<h1><span>Ask a pharmacist with owner and associate Anita Brown, Certified Diabetes Educator, Okotoks, Alta.</span></h1>
			<p>“The type of glucose meter that’s right for you depends on the type of diabetes you have, the frequency of monitoring required and the level of technology you want. It’s also important to assess your needs: Do you want a blood sugar monitor so you can maintain a log? Or are you interested in using one that has some sort of technology associated with it?</p>
			<p>“With Type 1 diabetes, you’re looking for a monitor that is advanced, because you’re taking insulin. The <span class+"bold">FreeStyle InsuLinx</span>, which is a mealtime insulin calculator, can help people who use insulin many times throughout the day. Research has shown that people using this type of monitor are better protected against low blood sugars because they’re more accurately estimating the correct insulin doses. Nine out of 10 people will be using less insulin as a result of this.</p>
			<p>“There’s also the <span class+"bold">OneTouch Verio IQ</span>, which is an excellent monitor for people who are using multiple daily doses of insulin, because it helps them identify patterns in their blood sugar.”</p>

			<h1><span>Tracking blood sugars</span></h1>
			<p>A1C testing</p>
			<p>While glucose meters assess blood sugar for the exact moment at which it’s tested, only an A1C test can take into account a much longer time frame—the past three months—to assess blood sugar control. Your physician may test for it once every three months, or even annually, if they feel it is appropriate for you.</p>
			<p>The test is similar to blood sugar testing, in that it requires a small blood sample. But instead of strips, a cartridge is used, because a few more steps are needed to examine the sample. It takes about five minutes for results, versus the few seconds it takes for the blood sugar testing you would do every day.</p>
			<p>You can have the A1C test done at select Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacies, and you can also buy a kit to take home. To help understand the results and to ensure proper testing procedures, it’s best to have it done at the pharmacy or have your pharmacist review the analysis.</p>
			<p>Contact your local Shoppers Drug Mart for info on the in-store A1C test. <a href="http://www1.shoppersdrugmart.ca/en/Store-Locator.aspx">http://www1.shoppersdrugmart.ca/en/Store-Locator.aspx</a></p>
			
			<h1><span>Diabetes logbook</span></h1>
			<p>Keep track of everyday sugar levels by writing down readings in the Shoppers Drug Mart Diabetes Logbook. Convenient to carry (smaller and thinner than a chequebook), it records up to 12 weeks of results and is a great tool for reporting glucose meter results to a health care provider. The logbook is straightforward, making it easy to visually understand progress in controlling sugar levels. Other features include a reference section on managing diabetes and target blood sugar levels, a medication list and a schedule. The Shoppers Drug Mart Diabetes Logbook is free—just ask for it at the pharmacy counter.</p>

			<h1><span>How to check your ketone levels</span></h1>
			<p>What are ketones?</p>
			<p>Ketones are created in the liver when fat is converted into energy. Glucose is energy from carbohydrates. When you don't have enough glucose to use for energy, your body will use ketones.</p>
			<p>How are ketones tested?</p>
			<p>To check ketone levels, a urine or blood test is given. A positive test means that there are ketones in the sample, which could be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis.  If this happens, you should contact your health care provider right away, as diabetic ketoacidosis may an early sign of kidney failure, heart attack or fluid buildup in the brain.</p>
