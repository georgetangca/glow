			<p class="greenFeature"><span>“My name is Colin. I’m now 16 and am living an active and healthy lifestyle with Type 1 diabetes.</span></p>
			<div class="paragraph-area">
			<h1><span>My diary</span></h1>
			<p>I participate in many activities, like all teenagers do. I love to play soccer and hockey, and I bike and ski. I also have my level-one coaching card and level-one ski instructor certificate.</p>
			<p>“I was diagnosed at 18 months old, so I don’t know life without diabetes. Over the years, I’ve adapted [to my condition] and have been improving how I control my diabetes. I went from a couple of needles of insulin a day to seven needles, to now taking one needle every three days and an insulin pump. I have to have insulin injected when I eat food.</p>
			<p>“This disease hasn’t kept me down at all. It doesn’t affect what I eat or drink. I’m just like any other teenager—I can eat any food I want, but I prefer to steer clear of sugary foods like cake and pop. If I had to give advice to anyone else who has diabetes, just remember five things: test often, eat healthy, don’t eat unless you’ve checked your blood sugar level and have taken insulin to correct it, bring your test kit and insulin everywhere, and, finally, don’t lose your test kit. The reason I said the last thing is because I have a tendency to lose things.</p>
			<p>“So, in conclusion, diabetes is just a hurdle I try to get over daily, and it’s not too difficult to do it if you’re not lazy.”</p>

			<h1><span>From the dietitian:</span></h1>
			<p>“You do a great job looking after your diabetes: testing your blood sugar, counting carbs, insulin pumping and keeping yourself fit. You said you prefer to steer clear of sugary foods like pop— this is an important choice. Drinking too many sweet beverages every day, including pop and juice, is making so many teenagers and adults overweight. Your way of eating is good for everyone.</p>
			<p>“I wasn’t sure if your food record included all the foods you ate that day, as it didn’t look like enough calories for a young, athletic, growing guy like yourself. To help you grow and have a healthy weight, you may need to adjust your food portions and, correspondingly, your insulin. Also, it’s good to eat several pieces of fruit and try for two or more veggies each day. </p>
			<p>“I’m sure that, as an athlete, you have more than enough experience in dealing with low blood sugars. But, generally, we recommend that if your reading is under 4.0, you should first treat it with 15 grams [three teaspoons] of fast sugar, and then follow up with your lunch. Good luck with your athletic endeavours!”</p>
			<p>Three tips for Colin:</p>
			<p>1.       Include three to four servings of milk and milk products every day. One serving is a cup of milk or ¾ yogurt or 1½ ounces of cheese.</p>
			<p>2.       Eat extra vegetables when you are on the run: cucumber or zucchini sticks, pieces of raw red or yellow pepper, baby carrots, snap pea pods, small tin of tomato juice, celery sticks filled with peanut butter or cheese whiz, or broccoli or cauliflower with ranch dressing.</p>
			<p>3. You may have wondered whether energy drinks are something you can have. They have on average 11 to 15 teaspoons of sugar per 16 ounces, so you will need to adjust your insulin for this. They also have a lot of caffeine, which may not all be listed, as it may be from herbal sources such as yerba matte. The combination of high sugar and caffeine can cause some people with diabetes to become dehydrated, so it’s risky.</p>
