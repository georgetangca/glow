			<p>It starts with a loss of sensation due to damaged nerves, says Dr. Jan Hux, Chief Scientific Advisor at the Canadian Diabetes Association. "Those messages of pain that we get from our feet are really important to alert us to a little cut or a little blister, and the problem is that in people with diabetes, there’s an increased risk for infection, a decreased ability to fight infection and a decreased ability to heal." Take our symptom-checker quiz.</p>

			<p>If you answer "yes" to any of these questions, seek medical attention. In addition to having proper-fitting shoes and socks, it's important to schedule regular doctor's appointments for foot examinations. Have a friend or family member help inspect your feet daily. (For example, Dr. Hux says to look where a shoe might rub and where calluses might form.) Also consider visiting a chiropodist or a podiatrist to have your nails and feet cared for professionally.</p>
