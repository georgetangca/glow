			<p class="greenFeature"><span>“My name is Christopher.  I’m 30 years old and was recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.</span></p>
			<div class="paragraph-area">
			<h1><span>My diary</span></h1>
			
			<p>The first symptom was with my eyesight: It was like I’d temporarily lost my vision. And then I noticed I had to go to the washroom much too often. That’s when I decided to get checked. My father has diabetes and I was overweight. I worried it might be diabetes, and it was.</p>
			<p>“I’ve always loved food, but now, seeing the error of my ways, I’ve had to change my way of eating. Sure, there are days when I don’t stick to the plan, but I’m only human. Now I don’t go on fast-food benders, [but] if I want something not on my food schedule or if I’m out with friends, I don’t worry too much about sticking with my diet. It would drive me crazy not to have one day off, so to speak. This is a journey, and I now have a better understanding of what is good and not good to eat. And humour is always the best medicine.”</p>

			<h1><span>From the dietitian</span></h1>
			<p>“I like how your humour. It's good for you and it improves blood sugar and blood pressure. You recognize that, now and again, you need to relax and enjoy your favourites—in moderation. You can think of it as a ‘treat budget,’ where you give yourself permission to have a treat now and again. It’s what you do the other 95 per cent of the time that is most important. Looking at your food record, I can see that you have taken steps to eat smaller, healthy portions, which is great.</p>
			<p>I do wonder if, along with your diet changes, you have also started to be physically active. Walking for 20 to 30 minutes helps improve blood sugar and helps makes your insulin work better.</p>
			<p>Here are three tips</p>
			<p>1. Limit sweet drinks, such as soft drinks, sweetened coffees, smoothies and alcoholic beverages. Beware, a 40-ounce slushie has 33 teaspoons of sugar!</p>
			<p>2. It’s important when you’re first diagnosed with diabetes to go and have your eyes checked by an optometrist. This way changes in your eyes because of diabetes can be treated right away.</p>
			<p>3. Eat fish or seafood at least once a week. Fish, especially cold-water ocean fish, is a great source of omega-3 fats, vitamin D and other nutrients such as selenium. All of these are important in diabetes management.”</p>
