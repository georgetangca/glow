			<p>“Having diabetes increases the risk for developing coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (heart attack). And because controlling blood sugars is necessary to prevent a heart attack or stroke, a diet that’s low in saturated fats and high in fibre is key. The dietary recommendations in Canada’s Food Guide are always best. That said, there are a lot of natural health products that may also help to prevent cardiovascular disease and, ultimately, heart attacks. Here are a few.</p>
			<p>Fish oils—including omega-3, -6 and -9 fatty acids—are known to help reduce risk. Essentially, you should be looking for a supplement that offers a combination of polyunsaturated fatty acids called EPA and DHA.</p>
			<p>There is some evidence to suggest that garlic—specifically aged garlic—helps reduce the risk for heart attack. If you can add it to your diet, that’s great. If you’re not a big fan of the taste, supplements can be easier to take.</p>
			<p>The antioxidant coenzyme Q10 is another health product that we think may help with cardiovascular disease.</p>
			<p>Psyllium fibre, which can be found in LIFEBRAND PRODUCTTK, can help lower cholesterol—namely the bad kind, LDL. It is inexpensive and very easy to take. It is also taken for constipation, but we’re starting to see it marketed for heart health as well.</p>
			<p>And don’t forget your multivitamin.”</p>
