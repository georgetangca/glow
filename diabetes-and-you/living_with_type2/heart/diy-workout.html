			<h1><span>Walking Workouts for Managing Diabetes</span></h1>
			
			<p>An active lifestyle can help control blood glucose levels and the body’s sensitivity to insulin. Try one of these walking workouts by Amanda Vogel, MA human kinetics. (Be sure to get clearance from your doctor to exercise, and check out the safety tips below.)</p>
			<p>What’s your BMI? The Body Mass Index helps provides a weight-to-height ratio, in order to gauge whether you are at risk for health issues or diseases.

			<h1><span>Before you start:</span></h1>
			
			<p>Follow these safety tips for exercising with diabetes, from Mary Ann Masesar, a fitness nurse consultant and a Get Fit for Active Living diabetes facilitator. She is the co-owner of Higher Level Fitness in Winnipeg.</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Check with your doctor before starting or resuming an exercise program.</li>
				<li>Work out with a buddy who knows you have diabetes and can recognize and respond to signs of complications.</li>
				<li>Check your feet daily and after every workout. Diabetes can be associated with decreased pain sensitivity in the feet, making it harder to feel injury or discomfort in that area, such as cuts, blisters or a stone in your shoe.</li>
				<li>To prevent hypoglycemia (low glucose levels) during exercise, bring your glucose-monitoring device. Test blood sugar 30 minutes before exercise and immediately after exercising. Monitor how your body reacts to certain types of exercise and intensities.</li>
				<li>Carry portable, high-glycemic drinks and snacks with you; for example, fruit juice (1/2 cup of orange or pineapple juice), a banana or a date bar.</li>

			<h1><span>Beginner Walking Workout (30 minutes):</span></h1>
			<p>Try this workout if you haven’t exercised in the past three months or more. Start with two days a week, working up to three days a week.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">First 7 minutes:</span> Walk at an easy pace to warm up. You should be able to speak comfortably.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 18 minutes:</span> Increase to a moderately brisk pace, pumping your arms and widening your stride. Your breathing should get deeper. You can speak in short sentences, but not as easily as during the warm-up.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Final 5 minutes:</span> Cool down with an easy walk. End with stretching all major muscles.</p>
			
			<h1><span>Intermediate Walking Workout (40 minutes):</span></h1>
			<p>Go for this workout if you’ve been walking for at least three months and you’re ready for a greater challenge. Start with three times a week, working up to four times.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">First 5 minutes:</span> Walk at an easy pace to warm up. You should be able to speak comfortably.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 15 minutes:</span> Increase to a brisk pace, pumping your arms and widening your stride. Your breathing should get deeper. You can speak in short sentences but not as easily as during the warm-up.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 10 minutes:</span> Increase your pace slightly for about 30 seconds by speeding up, or, if you’re using a treadmill, set it to a slight incline. You should be breathing deeply and only able to speak a few words at a time by the end of the 30 seconds.</p>
			<p>Walk at a moderate pace for one minute, then try another 30-second interval at a slightly faster pace or a higher incline. Repeat this pattern until the 10 minutes are up.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 5 minutes:</span> Go back to a brisk pace.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Final 5 minutes:</span> Cool down with an easy walk. End with stretching all major muscles.</p>
			<p>If you are not partial to walks, you can always join a group fitness class or athletic team at your local community centre. Tell the coach or instructor you have diabetes and share the safety tips above with them.</p>
