In addition to regular checkups with your doctor to diagnose cardiovascular issues, the Heart & Stroke Foundation says to call 911 if you experience signs of a heart attack or stroke.</p>
			<p>In the event of a heart attack, signs include chest discomfort (pain, pressure, squeezing, burning, heaviness), discomfort in other areas of the upper body, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea and/or light-headedness.</p>
			<p>In the event of a stroke, signs include weakness; sudden loss of strength or sudden numbness in the face, arm or leg; difficulty speaking or sudden confusion; vision problems; headache and/or dizziness.</p>

			<h1><span>DIY Kidneys Symptom Checker</span></h1>
			
			<p>Did you know that there is a connection between the heart and the kidneys? As the heart pumps blood through the body, the kidneys are filtering it. So if there are issues with heart health, ultimately it will affect the kidneys. Also, there is a strong relationship between diabetes and kidney disease-and when you have diabetes, you have up to a 50 per cent chance of developing it, says Dr. Richard Tytus, associate clinical professor in the Department of Family Medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. "It's very important to see your doctor on a regular basis and have your blood tested and your kidney function tested," he says. "Your kidneys are 'windows' to the circulatory system. If it’s happening in small blood vessels in your kidneys, it's happening in the eyes, in the toes and in the heart." Take our symptom-checker quiz.</p>

				<li>Do you have high blood pressure?</li>
				<li>Do you experience water retention around the eyes, hands and feet?</li>
				<li>Do you have to urinate often?</li>
				<li>Do you have difficulty urinating?</li>
				<li>Does your urine look abnormal? Has its colour changed?</li>
				<li>Have you experienced a loss of appetite?</li>
				<li>Are you tired for no apparent reason?</li>
				<li>Is your skin itchy?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><span class="bold">When to see a doctor:</span> Even if you didn’t answer "yes" to any of these questions, talk to your doctor about your risk for kidney disease and diabetes. Kidney Disease can also have silent symptoms. You should get tested for kidney disease yearly if you have diabetes. If the tests come back normal, an annual checkup is fine, says Dr. Tytus. If you are diagnosed kidney disease, you should get tested about once every three months to monitor the condition, he says.</p>
