			<h1><span>Quick facts: Heart</span></h1>
			
			<p>Heart failure and stroke are both types of cardiovascular disease. Diabetes is a risk factor for heart disease.</p>
			
			<h1><span>Did you know?</span></h1>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Diabetes can increase the risk for heart disease. There is some evidence that the risk of heart attack in a middle-aged person with Type 2 diabetes is the same as someone who doesn’t have diabetes but has already had a heart attack.</li>
				<li>Heart disease and stroke can occur at a younger age in people with diabetes, compared to the rest of the population.</li>
				<li>Your risk of a cardiovascular problem increases with age, the length of time you’ve had diabetes, and other risk factors such as a family history of cardiovascular disease.</li>
				<li>You are less likely to survive a heart attack if you have diabetes.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h1><span>How does diabetes put heart and blood vessel function at risk?</span></h1>
			<p>When you have diabetes, the high blood sugar levels can eventually lead to plaque buildup on the walls of blood vessels (hardening of the arteries). And that can also cause:</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>High blood pressure</li>
				<li>Damage to tiny blood vessels</li>
				<li>Damage to nerves that help with blood flow</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h1><span>Reduce your risk!</span></h1>
			<p>For people with diabetes, the risk of a cardiovascular problem is reduced if they:</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Maintain a healthy weight</li>
				<li>Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet</li>
				<li>Get regular exercise</li>
				<li>Don’t smoke or stop smoking</li>
				<li>Make sure their blood pressure is well controlled</li>
				<li>Make sure their blood sugar is well controlled</li>
				<li>Make sure their cholesterol is kept within a healthy range</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h1><span>Good to know</span></h1>
			<p>Recognize the symptoms of a heart attack and stroke so you can ask for emergency help quickly and prevent severe damage to the heart or brain.</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Heart attack: discomfort in the chest, jaw, arms and/or back; shortness of breath; sweating; nausea; and/or light-headedness.</li>
				<li>Stroke: trouble speaking and seeing, headache, dizziness, and weakness.</li>
			</ul>
