			<p>"First, it's important to understand why you should be concerned about your eye health. Diabetes is the single leading cause of blindness in Canada. It also raises the risk of developing blurred vision, cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and something called diabetic retinopathy, in which the small blood vessels in the retina become damaged. So if you're concerned about preventing diabetes, you should also be concerned about preventing any of these eye issues. 	As for how you can support your eye health: The most important thing is to control your blood sugars and maintain a well-balanced diet. In addition, there is some evidence mounting that certain vitamins and minerals can help prevent some of these complications in patients with diabetes. We know vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, copper, lutein and even beta-carotene can help. You can take them all individually or in a multi-vitamin created specifically for eye health. Check with your local pharmacist to see what is the best one for you." </p>
