			<h1><span>DIY Symptom Checker: Eyes</span></h1>
			<p>"Sixty per cent of patients with Type 2 diabetes have some kind of retinopathy during the first 20 years they have diabetes," says Dr. Keith Gordon, vice president, research and service quality at CNIB. He notes that both open-angle glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are often symptomless, so it’s important to test your eyes regularly, even if your sight seems normal. Any changes to your vision could indicate the disease has advanced. Take our symptom-checker quiz.</p>

			<h1><span>When to see a doctor:</span></h1> 
			<p>If you answer "yes" to any of these questions, get your eyes checked. "I encourage people to get regular eye exams—once a year or more often, if possible—especially if they have diabetes," says Dr. Gordon. If you experience any changes to your vision, see your eye doctor immediately. Dr. Gordon adds that there are treatments and drugs available to help control the diseases, so he advises asking your ophthalmologist about them if you have eye disease.</p>
