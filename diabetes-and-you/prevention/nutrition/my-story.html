			<h1><span>My diary</span></h1>
			
			<p>I would say I'm healthy: my blood work, BP and family medical history are on the plus side; I drink six glasses of water a day; I play and coach soccer; and I also play a lot of golf. But diabetes is in my family. My sister is now diabetic after being diagnosed with it during her first pregnancy. My uncle also has diabetes. Although I don't have diabetes, I want to eat better. I'm not happy with my weight and I’ve started to eat smaller portions, make better food choices, exercise more and go for regular checkups to monitor baseline measurements.”</p>

			<h1><span>From the dietitian</span></h1>
			<p>"It's human nature that we often don’t make changes until it’s too late. But when diabetes is diagnosed, research shows that, by then, some damage has often already happened.</p>
			<p>People might be more likely to do something early if they knew that even a few small changes could make a difference—for example, walking more, eating more fruits and vegetables, and a bit less sweet and fatty foods. Good for you for making changes now! You might be able to hold off diabetes for at least a few years, or maybe even forever.</p>
			<p>"It looks like you’ve cut out snacks and are now eating three balanced meals a day. These are good changes, since you want to lose weight. But you might be surprised to know that your 10 drinks with dinner is about 1,300 calories. One bottle of beer has about the same calories as two slices of bread, but six bottles is almost a whole loaf. Consider cutting back, switching to a light beer, or drinking less wine by using a smaller wine glass.</p>
			<p>"Not only are you establishing better eating and exercise habits for yourself, but you’ll also pass these good habits on to your two children. You and your wife are their role models. They will thank you someday for giving them this gift."</p>
			<p>Three tips for James:</p>
			<p>1.       Use less oil, or mix your oil with part flavoured vinegar to reduce the calories of your dip. Olive oil is healthy, but, like all fats, it is high in calories, about 45 calories per teaspoon.</p>
			<p>2.       Most chain restaurants have nutrient information listed online. Before you eat somewhere, look up the calories, fat, sodium and carbohydrates of the foods you may want to eat. You might change your mind.</p>
			<p>3.       If you drink coffee or tea every day, making even a small switch, for example a switch to a skinny latte or less sugar added, makes a big difference over the month.</p>
