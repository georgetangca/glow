			<p>While you might be concerned about counting carbs, know that not all carbs are created equal. Some are more nutritious than others. Despite having the same carb count (12 grams), you get more fibre, selenium and manganese from a slice of brown bread than you do from a cappuccino. Because diabetes can cause health complications, it's best you follow a healthy diet that will keep your weight in check, as well as your cholesterol. Generally go for low-calorie foods that are low in sugar and saturated fats and high in fibre.</p>
