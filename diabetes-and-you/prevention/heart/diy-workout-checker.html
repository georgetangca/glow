			<h1><span>Beginner Walking Workout (30 minutes): </span></h1>
			<p>Try this workout if you haven’t exercised in the past three months or more. Start with two days a week, working up to three days a week.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">First 7 minutes:</span> Walk at an easy pace to warm up. You should be able to speak comfortably.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 18 minutes:</span> Increase to a moderately brisk pace, pumping your arms and widening your stride. Your breathing should get deeper. You can speak in short sentences but not as easily as during the warm-up.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Final 5 minutes:</span> Cool down with an easy walk. End with stretching all major muscles.</p>
			
			<h1><span>Intermediate Walking Workout (40 minutes): </span></h1>
			<p>Go for this workout if you’ve been walking for at least three months and you’re ready to try a greater challenge. Start with three times a week, working up to four.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">First 5 minutes:</span> Walk at an easy pace to warm up. You should be able to speak comfortably.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 15 minutes:</span> Increase to a brisk pace, pumping your arms and widening your stride. Your breathing should get deeper. You can speak in short sentences, but not as easily as during the warm-up.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 10 minutes:</span> Increase your pace slightly for about 30 seconds by speeding up, or, if you’re using a treadmill, set it to a slight incline. You should be breathing deeply and only able to speak a few words at a time by the end of the 30 seconds. </p>
			<p>Walk at a moderate pace for one minute, then try another 30-second interval at a slightly faster pace or if using a treadmill set it at a higher incline. Repeat this pattern until the 10 minutes are up.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 5 minutes:</span> Go back to a brisk pace.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Final 5 minutes:</span> Cool down with an easy walk. End with stretching all major muscles.</p>
			<p>If you’re not partial to walks, you can always join a group fitness class or athletic team at your local community centre.</p>
