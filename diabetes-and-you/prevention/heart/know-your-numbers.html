			<h1><span>Know your numbers: How to read your blood pressure</span></h1>
			<p>A blood pressure reading shows how hard the heart is pumping by measuring the force of the blood pressing on the walls of the arteries. The higher the numbers, the harder your heart is working.</p>
			<p>Below 140/90</p>
			<p>This is a "normal" blood pressure reading (measured in 'mmHG' or millimetres of mercury). The top number (systolic) measures pressure of the arteries when the heart contracts and the bottom number (diastolic) measures it when the heart relaxes.</p>
			<p>For most people with diabetes, blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg or greater is considered high, and their doctor should monitor it.</p>
