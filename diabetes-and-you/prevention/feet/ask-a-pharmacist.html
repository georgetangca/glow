			<p>“Foot issues can sometimes be a sign of diabetes. High blood glucose can cause damage to nerves in the feet, so a person might not feel pain, heat or cold. This lack of feeling is called peripheral neuropathy, and it can lead to infection. Poor blood flow makes it hard for a sore or an infection to heal. Smoking when you have diabetes makes blood flow problems worse. </p>
			<p>“Keep your feet healthy by managing your blood glucose levels, wearing properly fitted shoes and asking your health care provider for help if you experience any problems. Assemble a foot-care kit that contains nail clippers, a nail file, lotion or moisturizer, a pumice stone and a non-breakable hand mirror.”</p>
