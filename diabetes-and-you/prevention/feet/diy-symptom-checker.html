			<p>It starts with a loss of sensation due to damaged nerves, says Dr. Jan Hux, Chief Scientific Advisor at the Canadian Diabetes Association. "Those messages of pain that we get from our feet are really important to alert us to a little cut or a little blister, and the problem is that in people with diabetes, there’s an increased risk for infection, a decreased ability to fight infection and a decreased ability to heal." Take our symptom-checker quiz. </p>

				<li>Have you lost sensation in your feet?</li>
				<li>Do you feel an electric or burning sensation in your feet?</li>
				<li>Do you have dry, cracked skin?</li>
				<li>Do you have any sores, cuts, blisters or hangnails?</li>
				<li>Do you have calluses or corns?</li>
				<li>Do you see any areas of redness?</li>
				<li>Are your feet swollen?</li>
				<li>Have your feet or toes changed shape?</li>
				<li>Are your nails thick and/or ingrown?</li>
			</ul>
