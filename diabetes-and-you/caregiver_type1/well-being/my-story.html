			<h1><span>MY STORY</span></h1>
			<p>Carbohydrate counting, insulin injecting, blood sugar checking, these routines were not always a necessity in our lives. </p>
			<p>Before my daughter’s diagnosis, I knew nothing of this diabetes life I live now. My daughter, Cara, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was three years old. Diabetes immediately embedded itself into every aspect of our family life. At first, instinctively, my focus was on mastering this disease. I fixated on controlling my daughter’s diabetes, however, the harsh reality and perhaps one of the most difficult elements of parenting a child living with Type 1 was soon realized. Type 1 diabetes is dynamically complex. </p>
			<p>Even though I did everything exactly the same for two days in a row, the outcome could be completely different. I finally came to the realization that living with diabetes was more like a delicate dance: Type 1 takes the lead, and I am left to react to its moves. Whether it’s finding the perfect insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio during mealtime, or correcting a drop in blood sugar, it can cause a reaction. </p>
			<p>Parenting a child with diabetes can be challenging.  You have to eliminate self-doubt and feel confident in your abilities as a caregiver, understanding there are no “mistakes”. </p>
			<p>I am no longer focused on power or control. I now use the knowledge I have of diabetes and the way it affects my daughter to enable me to quickly adapt, make adjustments and to find my footing after any missteps. </p>
