			<h1><span>DIY Symptom Checker: Eyes</span></h1>
			<p>"Sixty per cent of patients with Type 2 diabetes have some kind of retinopathy during the first 20 years they have diabetes," says Dr. Keith Gordon, vice-president research and service quality at CNIB. He notes that both open-angle glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are often symptomless, so it's important that your loved one has their eyes tested regularly, even if their sight seems normal. Any changes to their vision could indicate the disease has advanced. Take our symptom-checker quiz.</p>

			<h1><span>When to see a doctor:</span></h1> 
			<p>If they answer "yes" to any of these questions, ensure they get their eyes checked. "I encourage people to get regular eye exams once a year--or more often, if possible--especially if they have diabetes," says Dr. Gordon. If they experience any changes to their vision, arrange for them see an eye doctor immediately. Dr. Gordon adds that there are treatments and drugs available to help control the diseases, so he advises asking an ophthalmologist about them if your loved one has eye disease.</p>
