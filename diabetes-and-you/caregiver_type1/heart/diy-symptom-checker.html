			<p><span class="bold">When to see a doctor:</span> If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, the one you are caring for may be at risk for heart disease. In addition to regular checkups with their doctor to diagnose cardiovascular issues, the Heart & Stroke Foundation says to call 911 if you see signs of a heart attack or stroke. 
In the event of a heart attack, signs include chest discomfort (pain, pressure, squeezing, burning, heaviness), discomfort in other areas of the upper body, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea and/or light-headedness.
In the event of a stroke, signs include weakness; sudden loss of strength or sudden numbness in the face, arm or leg; difficulty speaking or sudden confusion; vision problems; headache and/or dizziness.</p>

			<h1><span>DIY Kidneys Symptom Checker</span></h1>
			<p>Did you know that there is a connection between the heart and the kidneys? As the heart pumps blood through the body, the kidneys are filtering it. So if there are issues with heart health, ultimate it will affect the kidneys. Also, there is a strong relationship between diabetes and kidney disease—and when someone has diabetes, they have up to a 50 per cent chance of developing it, says Dr. Richard Tytus, associate clinical professor in the Department of Family Medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. "It's very important for them to see their doctor on a regular basis and have their blood tested and kidney function tested," he says. “Kidneys are 'windows' to the circulatory system. If it's happening in small blood vessels in your kidneys, it's happening in the eyes, in the toes and in the heart." Take our symptom-checker quiz.</p>

				<li>Do they have to urinate often?</li>
				<li>Do they have difficulty urinating?</li>
				<li>Does their urine look abnormal? Has its colour changed?</li>
				<li>Have they experienced a loss of appetite?</li>
				<li>Are they tired for no apparent reason?</li>
				<li>Is their skin itchy?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><span class="bold">When to see a doctor:</span> Even if you didn't answer "yes" to any of these questions, talk to your doctor about your risk for kidney disease and diabetes. Kidney Disease can also have silent symptoms. Make sure your loved one is getting tested for kidney disease yearly. If the tests come back normal, an annual checkup is fine, says Dr. Tytus. If they have kidney disease, they should get tested about once every three months to monitor the condition, he says.</p>
