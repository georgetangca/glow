			<h1><span>DIY Walking Workouts for Managing Diabetes</span></h1>
			<p>Have your loved one try one of these walking workouts by Amanda Vogel, MA human kinetics. (Be sure to get clearance from their doctor to exercise, and check out the safety tips below.)  </p>
			<p>Other than being good for their fitness, the Canadian Diabetes Association says that exercising can also help lower their blood glucose levels and help the insulin they take be more effective.</p>
			<p>What is their BMI? The Body Mass Index provides a weight-to-height ratio, in order to gauge whether someone may be at risk for health issues or diseases.

			<h1><span>Before starting:</span></h1>
			<p>Follow these safety tips for exercising with diabetes, from Mary Ann Masesar, a fitness nurse consultant and a Get Fit for Active Living diabetes facilitator. She is the co-owner of Higher Level Fitness in Winnipeg.</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Check with their doctor before they start or resume an exercise program. </li>
				<li>Work out with them, and recognize and respond to signs of complications.</li>
				<li>Check their feet daily and after every workout. Diabetes can be associated with decreased pain sensitivity in the feet, making it harder to feel injury or discomfort in that area, such as cuts, blisters or a stone in their shoe.</li>
				<li>To prevent hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) during exercise, be sure they bring their glucose-monitoring device. Have them test their blood sugar 30 minutes before exercise and immediately after exercising. Monitor how their body reacts to certain types of exercise and intensities.</li>
				<li>Bring portable, high-glycemic drinks and snacks; for example, fruit juice (1/2 cup of orange or pineapple juice), a banana or a date bar.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h1><span>Beginner Walking Workout (30 minutes):</span></h1>
			<p>Try this workout if they haven’t exercised in the past three months or more. Start with two days a week, working up to three days a week.  </p>
			<p><span class="bold">First 7 minutes:</span> Walk at an easy pace to warm up. They should be able to speak comfortably.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 18 minutes:</span> Increase to a moderately brisk pace, with arms pumping and the stride widening. Breathing should get deeper. They should be able to speak in short sentences, but not as easily as during the warm-up.   </p>
			<p><span class="bold">Final 5 minutes:</span> Cool down with an easy walk. End with stretching all major muscles.</p>
			<h1><span>Intermediate Walking Workout (40 minutes):</span></h1>
			<p>They should consider this workout if they’ve been walking for at least three months and are ready to try a greater challenge. Start with three times a week, working up to four times, to reach the recommended goal of 150 minutes of exercise per week.  </p>
			<p><span class="bold">First 5 minutes:</span> Walk at an easy pace to warm up. They should be able to speak comfortably.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 15 minutes:</span> Increase to a brisk pace, with arms pumping and the stride widening. Breathing should get deeper. They should be able to speak in short sentences, but not as easily as during the warm-up.   </p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 10 minutes:</span> Increase the pace slightly for about 30 seconds by speeding up, or, if they are using a treadmill, set it to a slight incline. They should be breathing deeply and only able to speak a few words at a time by the end of the 30 seconds.  </p>
			<p>Walk at a moderate pace for one minute, then try another 30-second interval at a slightly faster pace or a higher incline. Repeat this pattern until the 10 minutes are up. </p>
			<p><span class="bold">Next 5 minutes:</span> Go back to a brisk pace. </p>
			<p><span class="bold">Final 5 minutes:</span> Cool down with an easy walk. End with stretching all major muscles. </p>
			
			<p>If your loved one isn't partial to walks, you can always get them to join a group fitness class or athletic team. Tell the coach or instructor that they have diabetes and share the safety tips above with them.</p>
