			<p class="greenFeature"><span>Like any high-functioning machine, the human body needs fuel for energy. Our body uses insulin from our pancreas to make use of glucose (energy) from foods with starch, natural sugars and dairy, such as breads, pastas, fruit and milk. </span></p>

			<h1><span>Insulin 101</span></h1>
			<p>Unfortunately, the pancreas of people with Type 1 diabetes cannot produce insulin. So, instead of being used for energy, glucose builds up—sometimes dangerously so—in the blood. However, Type 1 diabetes can be managed through insulin therapy—a lifeline for people with this type of diabetes.</p>
			<h1><span>What type of insulin is best?</span></h1>
			<p>When considering types of insulin, insulin regimens and blood glucose target ranges, one size definitely does not fit all. Determining what will work best depends on a variety of factors such as age, health and lifestyle. The doctor will prescribe the type and dosage. Options for insulin delivery include syringes, pens and pumps, all which have been designed to be as convenient to use and pain-free as possible. </p>
			<p>In order to continue to accurately determine the correct dosage of insulin, you’ll need a blood glucose meter to monitor your blood glucose levels on a regular basis. There are a variety of blood glucose meters, which can be purchased from your local pharmacy. The FreeStyle InsuLinx, for example, is an advanced model meal-time insulin calculator that has been shown in studies to better protect people with Type 1 diabetes against low blood sugars, which also resulted in the use of less insulin. </p>
			<h1><span>How to manage diabetes</span></h1>
			<p>The Canadian Diabetes Association lists numerous steps people with Type 1 diabetes can take to maintain and enhance their health:</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li><span class="bold">Take insulin</span> according to your doctor-prescribed regimen.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Check blood glucose</span> levels regularly to ensure they are within your target range.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Keep a healthy lifestyle</span> by eating properly and exercising regularly; keep cholesterol and weight in appropriate ranges; don’t smoke; manage stress; keep blood pressure at target; and take care of your feet.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Visit your dentist, eye care specialist</span> and <span class="bold">doctor</span> at regularly.</li>
			</ul>	
			<h1><span>What to watch for: Hypoglycemia</span></h1>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>This is when the blood sugar is too low (below 4 mmol/L), which can be dangerous. </li>
				<li>It can be caused by intense exercise, which lowers blood sugar levels. </li>
				<li>Blood sugar can drop when sick with a cold or flu, so check blood glucose levels about every two to four hours.</li>
				<li>Symptoms include: headache, vision problems, trembling, sweating, difficulty focusing, stomach pains, nausea and/or fast heartbeat. Hypoglycemia may result in a seizure, fainting or even a coma.</li>
				<li>Generally treatment includes consuming sugar, whether it is in tablet form, pop, juice or candy, and if that doesn't work to call 9-1-1. Check with your health care provider about what to do in this type of situation.</li>
