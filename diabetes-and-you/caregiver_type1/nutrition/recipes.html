			<p>Ingredients:</p>
			<p>1 tsp (5 ml) olive oil</p>
			<p>1 cooking onion, diced</p>
			<p>2 cloves garlic, crushed</p>
			<p>1 lb (500 g) extra-lean ground beef</p>
			<p>1 cup (250 ml) whole-wheat couscous</p>
			<p>2 medium eggplants</p>
			<p>1 796-ml can diced tomatoes </p>
			<p>½ cup (125 ml) red wine (or low-sodium vegetable broth)</p>
			<p>1 tsp (5 ml) dry Italian spices (or a blend of oregano, rosemary and basil)</p>
			<p>½ tsp (2 ml) salt</p>

			<p>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).</p>
			<p>Over medium heat, add oil to sauté pan. Add onion and crushed garlic. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes, until onion becomes translucent. Add ground beef and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until meat is cooked thoroughly (no longer pink).</p>
			<p>Cook couscous according to package instructions. Set aside.</p>
			<p>Cut eggplants in half, lengthwise. Core, leaving about half an inch of eggplant on the skin. Dice the eggplant that was removed from the skin. Add eggplant to ground beef, stirring mix occasionally, cooking for about 5 min. Add canned tomatoes, wine (or vegetable broth) and seasoning, and cook for another 2 minutes.</p>

			<p>Place the stuffed eggplants on a baking sheet and pour ½ cup (125 ml) of water over each, and cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil, add mozzarella cheese on top, and broil until cheese is melted and golden brown. Serve.</p>

			<h1><span>NUT AND APRICOT BARS</span></h1>
			
			<p>Nuts are rich in healthy fats that are good for your heart’s health. Dried apricots will provide the necessary sweetness to these bars, but since they have a low glycemic index, this will result in a slower increase in blood sugar. (See a nut-free version of this recipe below.)</p>
			<p>Ingredients:</p>
			<p>Olive oil spray</p>
			<p>1½ tbsp (22 ml) melted butter</p>
			<p>2 tbsp (25 ml) honey</p>
			<p>2 tbsp (25 ml) unsweetened applesauce</p>
			<p>1½ cup (375 ml) rolled oats</p>
			<p>2 eggs</p>
			<p>½ tsp (2 ml) vanilla extract</p>
			<p>½ cup (125 ml) almonds</p>
			<p>½ cup (125 ml) pistachios</p>
			<p>¼ cup (50 ml) sunflower seeds</p>
			<p>6 dried apricots, sliced</p>
			<p>2 tbsp (25 ml) honey</p>
			<p>½ tsp (2 ml) ground cinnamon</p>
			<p>Instructions:</p>
			<p>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Spray an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with oil and line with parchment paper. </p>
			<p>Mix melted butter and honey together in a glass bowl, and heat in microwave for 20 seconds on high, or until the mixture becomes liquified. Add applesauce and oats. Mix until well combined.</p>
			<p>With your hands or a silicon spatula, scoop out mixture, and firmly and evenly press into the baking pan. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</p>
			<p>While the crust is baking, lightly beat two eggs in a large bowl and add remaining ingredients. Stir well, until all nuts and fruits are evenly coated. Pour mixture over baked crust, making sure to distribute evenly. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
			<p>Let cool completely before cutting into 16 squares. Serve.</p>
			<p>Makes 16 servings. Nutrients per serving: 115 calories, 6 g fat (1 g saturated fat, 0 g trans fat), 28 mg cholesterol, 10 mg sodium, 13 g carbohydrates (2 g fibre, 7 g sugar), 4 g protein</p>
			
			<h1><span>NUT-FREE COCONUT AND APRICOT BARS </span></h1>
