			<p class="greenFeature"><span>“My name is Nicole. I’m married and I have six children. To look at my daughter, Cara, you would have no idea she has Type 1 diabetes.</span></p>
			<div class="paragraph-area">
			<h1><span>My Story</span></h1>
			
			<p>Cara is a fun-loving, happy and very shy seven-year-old. She was diagnosed when she was three. Cara was continually hungry, urinating frequently and extremely thirsty. She had lost a tremendous amount of weight and started to develop a rash on her bottom, all of which are classic signs of diabetes. However, we had no idea and, unfortunately for us, neither did her paediatrician. He sent us on our way. Five hours later she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in the ER.</p>
			<p>“In order for Cara to thrive with Type 1, every single carbohydrate that she ingests—food or drink—must be carefully measured and counted in order for us to inject the exact and precise amount of insulin needed to keep her body functioning as it should. This has dramatically changed the way I view food. A banana is no longer just a healthy, delicious fruit; it’s 21 grams of carbs that could cause a spike in blood sugar.</p>
			<p>“Cara is able to give herself insulin via her pump; however, she is just starting to learn how to count carbohydrates. Most of the work for managing her blood glucose falls on me and my husband, for now. She eats the same healthy, well-balanced foods that we strive to feed our other children and, just as with our other children, Cara can and will enjoy special snacks. As we see it, Cara is a child first: growing, learning and having fun. Diabetes comes second and the foods we choose to feed her echoes that sentiment.”</p>
			
			<p>Breakfast (35 g carbohydrates):</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>1 cup cereal with ½ cup 2% milk (35 g)</li>
				<li>no-calorie flavoured water (0g)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Morning snack (28 g carbohydrates):</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>1 cup green seedless grapes	(28 g)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At school there are a few rules around food. Cara is not allowed to share food and she must eat all the food for which insulin has been administered.</p>
			
			<p>Lunch (59 g):</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>“peanut butter” and jelly sandwich made with nut-free soy butter and strawberry jam (43 g)</li>

				<li>no-calorie flavoured water (0g)</li>

			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>1 apple (17 g)</li>
				<li>6 small pieces of cheddar cheese (0 g)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>*Cara was playing with her siblings and her blood sugar fell low. For a treat and to raise her blood sugar, I gave her 2 candy rolls (14 g carbohydrates) with no insulin.</p>
			
			<p>Dinner (40 g carbohydrates):</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>chicken breast (0 g)</li>

			</ul>

			<h1><span>From the dietitian</span></h1>
			<p>“It’s a lot of work and worry looking after a child with diabetes, and your success is that you’ve been able to normalize Cara’s life, in spite of her diabetes. You have included a variety of healthy foods but also treats in reasonable portions. As she gets older, she will have emotional ups and downs, as all kids do, but she will have a solid foundation of knowing how to look after her diabetes. Her learning curve will come naturally. Cara will soon be able to help make her own lunch and even help prepare supper. Show her pictures in cookbooks so she can help you come up with meal ideas. Having Type 1 diabetes will mean that food and exercise will always be an important part of Cara’s life.</p>
			<p>Here are three tips for Nicole and Cara:</p>
			<p>1.       Try nuts as a snack instead of potato chips, if Cara’s school allows it. She will need less insulin as the nuts will have less carbs. Nuts have healthy fats too.</p>
			<p>2.       For a treat, scoop out the core of a medium apple. Pierce the skin of the apple with a fork. In a small dish, mix ½ tsp of butter or margarine, 1½ tsp brown sugar, 1/8 tsp of cinnamon, 1/8 tsp of lemon juice, a dash of nutmeg and 1 tsp of raisins. Fill the apple with mixture and microwave on high for 1-2 minutes. (15 grams of carbs).</p>
			<p>3.       Chocolate milk has 15 g more carbs than white milk, so mix ½ cup chocolate milk with ½ cup skim milk. Also, choose one per cent fat chocolate milk.”</p>
