			<p>“The Glycemic Index [GI] ranks foods between 1 and 100 by how much blood glucose rises after they are eaten. Foods that raise blood glucose quickly and to a higher level have a high GI number, while those that raise blood glucose more slowly have a low GI number.</p>
			<p>“Choosing foods with a <span class="bold">low GI number</span> [55 or less] can help a person feel full, thereby controlling their appetite, as well as helping keep their blood glucose at target levels, control cholesterol and decrease their risk of heart disease. Food choices that have a low GI number include most fruits, vegetables and low-fat milk products.</p>
			<p>“Food choices that have a high GI number [70 or more] include instant rice, white bread and corn flakes. They will raise blood glucose levels quickly. [Medium GI foods are between 56 and 69.]</p>
			<p>“The Glycemic Index website [<a href="http://www.glycemicindex.com/foodSearch.php">http://www.glycemicindex.com/foodSearch.php</a>] provides a comprehensive data base of foods that rank as high, medium and low.  I recommend encouraging them to choose foods that minimally affect blood glucose, including vegetables—except for parsnips, peas, turnips and squash—fish and legumes, foods high in fibre, and sugar substitutes in place of white sugar or honey. You should also check out the Canadian Diabetes Association's Glycemic Index page: <a href="http://www.diabetes.ca/for-professionals/resources/nutrition/glycemic-index/">http://www.diabetes.ca/for-professionals/resources/nutrition/glycemic-index/</a></p>
			<p>“You also have to consider portion size, how the food was processed or prepared, and the entire meal. For how much to eat, follow the Handy Portion Guide from Canada’s Food Guide [<a href="http://www.diabetes.ca/diabetes-and-you/nutrition/portion-guide/">http://www.diabetes.ca/diabetes-and-you/nutrition/portion-guide/</a>]. Stick with foods that are minimally processed and try to avoid foods cooked in fat, such as those that are sautéed or deep-fried. And if their meal includes foods that are high on the Glycemic Index, be sure they eat them with something that has a low GI number.”</p>
