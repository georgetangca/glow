			<h1><span>Diabetes Basics: type-1 and type-2 diabetes</span></h1>
			<p>Ninety per cent of Canadians with diabetes have Type 2; 10 per cent have Type 1. What’s the difference between the two?</p>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>For people with Type 1 diabetes, their body cannot make insulin. That’s the hormone that breaks down sugar from food and converts it into energy for the body.</li>
				<li>For people with Type 2 diabetes, their body can produce insulin, but it is not making enough of it or it is no longer using it well.</li>
			</ul>	
			
			<p><span class="bold">In both diabetes types,</span> the buildup of sugar in the blood can rise dangerously high and lead to health problems.</p>
			<p>Here are other ways in which Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes differ:</p>
			
			<h1><span>Risk factors:</span></h1>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Type 1 diabetes runs in families. Other risk factors are not clear.</li>
				<li>Type 2 diabetes runs in families, too, but there are other known risk factors, including being overweight and/or inactive, and being over 45.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1><span>Prevention:</span></h1>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>Type 1 diabetes can’t be predicted or prevented. </li>
				<li>Type 2 diabetes can often be prevented by eating a well-balanced diet, getting regular exercise and maintaining a healthy body weight.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h1><span>Diagnosis:</span></h1>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>People are usually diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes as children or teens.</li>
				<li>People develop Type 2 diabetes as they get older. Although the number of young people with Type 2 diabetes is rising, it’s still uncommon. Most people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes are over 40.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1><span>Treatment:</span></h1>
			<ul class="custom-bullets">
				<li>People with Type 1 diabetes must inject insulin to manage their disease.</li>
				<li>People with Type 2 diabetes might never need insulin. They might need medications to help control their blood sugar levels. Often they can also manage the disease with diet and exercise.</li>
			</ul>
